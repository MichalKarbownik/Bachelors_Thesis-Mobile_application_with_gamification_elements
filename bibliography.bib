  year = {2001},
  abstract = {UML and use case modeling have the last few years received much attention. Use cases are used to describe the functional requirements of a system and a use case diagram shows the relationships among use cases and actors within a system. The semantics of use case diagrams are, however, often unclear. The aim of this dissertation is to point out ambiguities and limited expressiveness present in the current use case notation of UML and to indicate in which directions remedies to these deficiencies may be sought. Problems reported by researchers were identified and presented to a set of use case practitioners. Then a proposal of possible improvements of the use case notation, which should reduce the ambiguities and increase the expressiveness in the notation, was developed. To place some measurements on the value the proposal can have in practice, it was also presented to a set of practitioners. The proposal provides a suggestion of how to model various tricky situations in a use case diagram. Furthermore, the dissertation gives insight on how the use case technique is used in practice. Practitioners argue that the use case specifications are more important than the use case diagrams. They also argue that the purpose of use case diagrams is to describe a system\&\#39;s main functionalities and not details, and that as few use case relationships as possible should be used in use case diagrams.},

  abstract = {Abstract Participation of individual workers (i.e., solvers) is critical to the viability and success of crowdsourcing platforms. Past literature indicates that gamification artifacts, by intriguing solvers' intrinsic motivations, can encourage solvers' participation in crowdsourcing. Nevertheless, little research has systemically theorized how intrinsic motivations mediate the relationship between gamification artifacts and crowdsourcing participation. Based on the motivational affordance perspective and related literature, this study theorizes gamification artifacts i.e., point rewarding and feedback giving, and identifies four intrinsic motivations (i.e., self-presentation, self-efficacy, social bonds, and playfulness) in the context of crowdsourcing. It then hypothesizes the mediating effects of the four intrinsic motivations on the relationships between the two gamification artifacts and crowdsourcing participation. It tests the model using survey data from 295 solvers in a large crowdsourcing platform. Results show that self-presentation, self-efficacy and playfulness positively mediates the impacts of two gamification artifacts on solvers' participation. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.},

The literature review covers results, independent variables (examined motivational affordances), dependent variables (examined psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification), the contexts of gamification, and types of studies performed on the gamified systems. The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.},

In practice, it is difficult to manage and control user- centered design and system development processes sepa- rately. Based on a case study conducted in two software product companies, we have aimed to understand the role of usability specialists in the requirements engineering (RE) process. Our findings indicate that usability is still often seen as user interface design instead of a more comprehen- sive characteristic of a software product. Therefore, usabil- ity specialists had difficulties participating in early RE ac- tivities. To integrate usability as a natural part of the RE process, the usability teams have started to organize train- ing in their companies. The main purpose of the training is to ensure that usability is not relying solely on the work of specialists but becomes a common responsibility for the whole product development organization.},

Methods: The study was conducted with 4th-grade students at a primary school, located at the city center, during 2017\textendash 2018 academic years. There was no sampling in the research, all 4th-grade students of the school were reached. ``Personal Information Form'', ``Computer Game Addiction Scale'' and ``UCLA Loneliness Scale'' were used for collecting data. Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test, and Correlation Analysis were used to evaluate the data of the research. Results: 50.7\% (n=104) of the students were female, most frequent number of sister/brother was one 39.0\% (n=80), both their mother 31.7\% (n=65) and their father 34.1\% (n=69) were mostly high school graduated. The average scores that students got from the scales were; 48.66{$\pm$}.27.02 (min.: 21.00, max.: 105) for ``Computer Game Addiction Scale'' and 40.55{$\pm$}8.50 (min: 22.00, max.: 64) for ``UCLA Loneliness Scale''. A weak, positive and significant relationship was found between students' loneliness scale scores and computer game addiction scale scores (r=0.357; P{$<$}0.000). Conclusion: A significant relationship was found between students' computer game addiction and loneliness. It is suggested to perform children's loneliness and computer game addiction assessments, evaluate effectiveness and establish a rehabilitating treatment system among school-hospital-family for abnormal cases.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how different gamification implementations can increase crowdsourcees' motivation and participation in crowdsourcing (CS). To this end, we review empirical literature that has investigated the use of gamification in crowdsourcing settings. Overall, the results of the review indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation. When comparing crowdcreating, -solving, -processing and-rating CS approaches, the results show differences in the use of gamification across CS types. Crowdsourcing initiatives that provide more monotonous tasks most commonly used mere points and other simpler gamification implementations, whereas CS initiatives that seek for diverse and creative contributions have employed gamification in more manifold ways employing a richer set of mechanics. These findings provide insights for designers of gamified systems and further research on the topics of gamification and crowdsourcing.},

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of gamification in educational context, i.e. teaching numeracy at a primary school level. We study the appealing characteristics of engaging computer games from children's point of view, and investigate whether embedding the proposed characteristics into an educational tool enhances children's learning. The main characteristics we identify are levels of difficulties, feedback from the current level, and graphical presentation. They were then embedded into a Java-based open source programme based on ``Who wants to be a millionaire'' TV show, with the aim of teaching children numeracy (level 5 New Zealand curriculum). Two versions were created: feature enriched game (FEG) with all the features enabled and feature devoid game (FDG) with no extra features. We present the results of an evaluation study done with primary school children (n\,=\,120) over a period of two weeks. The effectiveness of the educational tool was measured using a pre-test and a post-test, as well as other indicators such as the frequency and duration of interaction. Results show that the FEG version was more effective in enhancing children's learning and they found it more engaging.},

It, therefore, affects both the costs of personal wellness and the healthcare. Gamification is an informal umbrella term for the use of video game elements in non-gaming systems that aim to improve user experience and user engagement. The current paper's focus is to introduce theoretical aspects of gamification and its potential impact on health-related contexts, as well as present the state-of-the-art on how gamification is being employed in such contexts. Examples from contexts such as exercise, nutrition, weight control, medication adherence, and hands' hygiene, among others, are included. Finally, the challenges inherent to the design of successful gamification strategies and approaches are discussed.},

The marketplace is chock full of choices but lacks essential information to aid parents' and educators' decision-making. In 2014, the "Joan Ganz Cooney Center", with partners at "New America", launched a new study of the most popular educational apps marketplace by focusing an in-depth inquiry on literacy-focused apps for children ages 0-8 years. Analyzed was a sample of 183 apps from among lists of the "Top 50" educational apps in popular app stores and those that had recently won critical acclaim from expert review sites. Next, the apps were examined along numerous dimensions, including characteristics of their descriptions (e.g., number of words used to describe each app; target audience age-range; specific skills mentioned) and features within their actual content (e.g., the nature of adult-directed information; types of activities).
