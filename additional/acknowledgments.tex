\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\thispagestyle{empty}
This work could not have been accomplished if not for the support I received from many great people.
\\\\
First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my girlfriend, Lucie Vitáková, whose bright soul and mind shine on my days, even in the moments of greatest despair.
\\\\
I am sincerely thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice to give me the best in life. Special thanks belong to my beloved sister for the smile she bestows upon the world, as well as other members of my family, whose support I feel despite the distance.
\\\\
I would like to thank PhD Krzysztof Waśko for his enthusiastic encouragement and advice. I would also like to mention all of the teachers and mentors that I had a privilege to meet over the course of my education, in particular from \textit{I Społeczne Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Zbigniewa Herberta} and \textit{Społeczne Gimnazjum nr 2 im. Zbigniewa Herberta} in Częstochowa, for their passion and wisdom, which they always eagerly shared.
\\\\
Acknowledgments go to all my friends from the university and high school. Their humour and kindness has been an invaluable asset.
\\\\
Finally, I would like to thank all the people of good will that I crossed paths with.
